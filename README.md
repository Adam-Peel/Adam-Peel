## Welcome!! I'm Adam 👋

I'm an aspiring software developer who has just completed a Full Stack Bootcamp with [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com). I'm seeking to retrain after a succesful period of leading National research projects for various charities.

In my spare time I can be found:
- 🏔️ In the great outdoors
- 🎹 Learning classical piano
- 📖 Reading classic novels
