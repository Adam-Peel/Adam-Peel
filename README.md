## Welcome!! I'm Adam 👋

I'm an aspiring software developer who has just completed a Full Stack Bootcamp with [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com), and will shortly be taking a part-time MSc Software Development with [Queen's University Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate-taught/software-development-part-time-msc/). 

I'm seeking to retrain into software development after a succesful period of leading National research projects for various charities.

In my spare time I can be found:
- 🏔️ In the great outdoors
- 🎹 Learning classical piano
- 📖 Reading classic novels
